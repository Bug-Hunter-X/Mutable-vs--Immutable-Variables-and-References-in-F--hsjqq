This example highlights a potential pitfall in F# programming related to the use of mutable and immutable variables in conjunction with references.  The `bug.fs` file shows incorrect usage leading to a compile-time error when attempting to modify an immutable value indirectly. The `bugSolution.fs` offers a corrected approach by making the variable mutable if modification through a reference is necessary.
